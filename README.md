# The Impact of Religious Intervention on Fertility Rates: A Synthetic Control Analysis of Patriarch Ilia II's Influence in Georgia

## Abstract

This study evaluates the impact of Patriarch Ilia IIâ€™s baptism initiative on fertility rates in Georgia using the Synthetic Control Method. The analysis reveals a substantial and sustained increase in fertility rates attributable to this culturally and religiously grounded intervention, estimating approximately 159,759 additional births from 2008 to 2022. Representing a 1.24% increase relative to the cumulative reproductive-age female population, these findings highlight the effectiveness of non-financial, culturally embedded pronatalist policies. The research underscores the importance of institutional trust and socio-cultural contexts in demographic interventions and provides valuable insights for policymakers aiming to mitigate demographic declines through culturally sensitive approaches.
